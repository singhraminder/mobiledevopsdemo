This is a sample Android App built (Java + Gradle) -> MobileDevOps Demo
It contains only on UI showing 3 things:
1. TitleBar (AppName):  MobileDevOps Demo
2. A text : Go Gitter 2020
3. Bottom text: App Version - 1.1 (dynamically picked from BUILD.config)

Now this app will be used for a DevOps Pipeline development.
